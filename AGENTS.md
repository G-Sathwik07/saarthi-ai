# This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

# Agent Instructions

## Main Rule
- Work with minimal changes. Do not rewrite unrelated code. Do not scan the full project unless required.

## Token Saving Rules
- Inspect only files needed for the current task.
- Do not read the whole codebase unless asked.
- Do not output full files unless requested.
- Use targeted edits instead of rewriting large files.
- Keep final response short.
- Mention only changed files and what changed.
- Do not explain obvious code.
- Do not repeat the user request.
- Do not create unnecessary abstractions.
- Do not install new packages unless absolutely needed.

## Code Style
- Write clean, simple, production-ready code.
- Use TypeScript properly.
- Avoid any unless there is no better option.
- Follow existing folder structure.
- Follow existing naming conventions.
- Reuse existing utilities, hooks, components, and styles.
- Do not refactor working code unless requested.
- Avoid duplicate code.

## Component Rules
- Create small reusable components.
- Keep page files mostly for layout and data flow.
- Move repeated UI into components.
- Move business logic into hooks, server actions, or utilities.
- Avoid very large JSX blocks.
- Keep components focused on one responsibility.
- Keep "use client" as low as possible.

## Next.js Rules
- Use Server Components by default.
- Use Client Components only for state, effects, browser APIs, or user interactions.
- Use server actions or API routes for backend logic.
- Validate input before database operations.
- Add loading, error, and empty states where needed.
- Never expose secrets to the client.

## UI Rules
- Use existing design system components first.
- Keep UI minimal, clean, responsive, and consistent.
- Avoid one-off styling.
- Use consistent spacing, typography, and colors.
- Do not redesign unrelated screens.

## Database/Auth Rules
- Do not change schema unless asked.
- Reuse existing database client.
- Always verify authenticated user before saving private data.
- Always associate user-owned data with userId.
- Do not duplicate user records.
- Store only necessary user information.

## Workflow
### Before coding:
- Identify the smallest set of files needed.
- Check existing components/utilities first.
- Make the smallest safe change.

### After coding:
- Run type check or relevant test if available.
- Summarize changed files only.
- Keep response concise.
